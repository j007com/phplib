Two document properties are defined: the title (SetTitle()) and the author (SetAuthor()). There are several ways to view them in Adobe Reader. The first one is to open the file directly with the reader, go to the File menu and choose the Properties option. The second one, also available from the plug-in, is to right-click and select Document Properties. The third method is to type the Ctrl+D key combination.
